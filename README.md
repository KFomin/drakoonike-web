## Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js version 14 or higher. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: This should be included with Node.js installation. You can verify your installation by running:
  ```
  npm -v
  ```
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```
git clone https://github.com/KFomin/drakoonike-web.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```
cd drakoonike-web
```

Install the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Compile and Hot-Reload for Development
Once the installation is complete, you can run the project in development mode:

```
npm run dev
```
This command will compile the project and start a local development server. You can view your application in a web browser at http://localhost:3000 (or another port if specified in your configuration).
